00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:12,705
I don′t want a lot for Christmas

2
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:17,008
There is just one thing I need

3
00:00:17,212 --> 00:00:20,811
I don′t care about the presents

4
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:24,208
Underneath the Christmas tree

5
00:00:24,406 --> 00:00:28,205
I just want you for my own

6
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:32,810
More than you could ever know

7
00:00:33,016 --> 00:00:38,815
Make my wish come true oh

8
00:00:39,019 --> 00:00:47,018
All I want for Christmas is you

9
00:00:57,102 --> 00:00:59,901
I don′t want a lot for Christmas

10
00:01:00,111 --> 00:01:03,810
There is just one thing I need‚ and I

11
00:01:04,018 --> 00:01:06,217
Don′t care about the presents

12
00:01:06,405 --> 00:01:09,404
Underneath the Christmas tree

13
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:12,711
I don′t need to hang my stocking

14
00:01:12,911 --> 00:01:15,810
There upon the fireplace

15
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:19,011
Santa Claus won′t make me happy

16
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:22,110
With a toy on Christmas day

17
00:01:22,304 --> 00:01:25,203
I just want you for my own

18
00:01:25,407 --> 00:01:28,506
More than you could ever know

19
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,607
Make my wish come true

20
00:01:31,809 --> 00:01:39,808
All I want for Christmas is you

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,599
I won′t ask for much this Christmas

22
00:01:44,807 --> 00:01:48,506
I won′t even wish for snow‚ and I

23
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:50,999
I just wanna keep on waiting

24
00:01:51,209 --> 00:01:54,208
Underneath the mistletoe

25
00:01:54,416 --> 00:01:57,315
I won′t make a list and send it

26
00:01:57,511 --> 00:02:00,510
To the North Pole for Saint Nick

27
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,609
I won′t even stay awake

28
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:07,006
To hear those magic reindeer click

29
00:02:07,204 --> 00:02:10,103
′Cause I just want you here tonight

30
00:02:10,307 --> 00:02:13,406
Holding on to me so tight

31
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,599
What more can I do

32
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:23,814
Oh‚ Baby all I want for
Christmas is you

33
00:02:26,718 --> 00:02:29,417
All the lights are shining

34
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:33,206
So brightly everywhere

35
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,699
And the sound of children′s

36
00:02:35,901 --> 00:02:40,000
Laughter fills the air

37
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:42,115
And everyone is singing

38
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:45,400
I hear those sleigh bells ringing

39
00:02:45,604 --> 00:02:47,003
Santa won′t you bring me

40
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,408
The one I really need

41
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:51,717
Won′t you please bring my
baby to me quickly

42
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:54,904
I don′t want a lot for Christmas

43
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:58,111
This is all I am asking for

44
00:02:58,305 --> 00:03:01,304
I just wanna see my baby

45
00:03:01,512 --> 00:03:04,511
Standing right outside my door

46
00:03:04,711 --> 00:03:07,610
I just want you for my own

47
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,799
More than you could ever know

48
00:03:11,017 --> 00:03:13,816
Make my wish come true

49
00:03:14,012 --> 00:03:22,011
Baby all I want for Christmas is you

50
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:35,412
All I want for Christmas is you‚ baby

# Project1: 

Restore is a project that aims to promote shopping in local businesses. For this reason, we have created four games through which players can accumulate points in order to win promotions and discounts in different stores. These four games are centered around Teresa, a sweet grandmother who is going shopping and needs your help in navigating the different stores.

ACCESS TO DATABASE AND ADMIN

The database script can be accessed from the database folder: restore.sql.

In order to have an admin user, log in with username "Alex" and password "1234pass". This user has administration privileges and access to all four games.
